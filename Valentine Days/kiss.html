        <h1>Happy Kiss Day 💋</h1>
        <i>"As we both look in each other eyes, and upon gazing your beautiful perfectly made face by GOD. I wish to stop this moment forever and forever gaze upon your beauty! Your perfect nose, cheeks, and your beautiful stunning eyes... You had your mask on most of the time but nvm. Your cheeks were so soft as if I'm melting and sinking in your skin as soon as I touch them; your sweet lips were so soft like fruit which I never wanted to let go. Kissing you is indeed is a dangerous act because I myself cannot stop myself from sinking in your skin... Love you... 💋❤️"</i><br>
